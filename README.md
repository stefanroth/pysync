# pysync
one directional folder sync via rsync

This script helps me to sync my web projects from my development environment (PHPStorm on MacOS X) to my test environment 
(vagrant on Ubuntu 17.10), as I found that commercial tools didn't quite fit my needs.

It doesn't do much more than to call rsync every half second, but it's quite useful.
